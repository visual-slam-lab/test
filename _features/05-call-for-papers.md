We invite <b>short papers</b> of novel or recently published research relevant to the topics of the workshop.
* Short papers are 2+n pages (2 pages content + references)
* Submissions must follow the [IEEE Conference double column format](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html)
* All accepted papers will be presented as posters at the workshop and published on the workshop website.
* Please indicate whether your paper falls into the <strong>‘novel’</strong> or <strong>‘previously published’</strong> category. Novel research papers are encouraged and can expect more substantial review feedback on their work. This is provided as a service to authors of novel papers and does not diminish the chance of acceptance.
* All accepted submissions will be considered for the best presentation award, where 3 finalists will be selected for 5-minute plenary presentations. While all submissions are eligible, novelty will be considered in finalist selection.
* Submissions are single blind and will be reviewed by members of the (extended) workshop committee.
* Submissions can optionally be accompanied by a video.
* <b>All accepted submissions will be considered for three awards: Best Paper, Best Poster, and Best Open-Source Contribution, each receiving a 150 USD gift card.</b>

### <strong>Invited topics</strong>
We invite submissions including, but not limited to:
* <b>SLAM Systems and Applications</b>: Novel approaches in SLAM, Visual Odometry, 3D Reconstruction, and Visual Place Recognition (VPR), with applications in robotics, autonomous vehicles, AR/VR, and more.
* <b>Tool Integration and Standardization</b>: Open-source tools and libraries for SLAM, improving baseline evaluations, and streamlining benchmarking processes.
* <b>Benchmarking and Reproducibility</b>: Standardization of datasets and evaluation methodologies, addressing challenges such as low-light conditions, harsh weather, and dynamic environments.
* <b>New Evaluation Metrics and Benchmarking Tools</b>: Methods and platforms to assess localization and mapping performance more effectively.
* <b>Future Directions and Industrial Applications</b>: The role of AI and machine learning in SLAM, and real-world applications in industry, commercial robotics, and emerging technologies.


<!-- ### <strong>Review Criteria</strong>

Novel submission will be evaluated on:
* Relevance to the topics of the workshop
* Recency and novelty
* Clarity of presentation
* Technical Quality
* Strength of results (i.e., the results show promise for early stage work, the (planned) experimental setup is adequate)

Papers that have previously been published will mainly be evaluated on the first two points (relevance and recency). If so, please mention in the submission where it has been published.

<!-- ### <strong>Call for Demonstrations</strong>
We invite live demonstrations during the poster session. These can either accompany a submitted paper or be standalone. For standalone demonstrations, please submit an up to two pages description and/or video of the demo. Demos will be evaluated on recency and relevance to the workshop.
